## Abstract

Videofluoroscopic Swallowing Study (VFSS)
is the gold standard for assessing swallowing disorders,
enabling detailed analysis of swallowing phases. Temporal
micro-action localization in VFSS, which needs to identify
and localize micro-actions (e.g., hyoid motion, {'<'}2s), is
critical for diagnosis but faces significant challenges due
to spatial ambiguity in noisy X-ray images and the extremely short duration of micro-actions. Existing methods
handle brief actions by either localizing swallowing events
before identifying micro-actions or trimming videos for focused analysis. However, they rely solely on appearance-
based data that are highly susceptible to noise and back-
ground interference. To this end, we propose Skeleton-
Guided Mamba for Temporal Micro-Action Localization (SG-
Mamba). Our method incorporates a novel skeleton modality that encodes the motion of key anatomical landmarks as
heatmap sequences, effectively suppressing noise and enhancing anatomical focus. We further introduce a Channel-
enhanced Cross-Mamba (CCM) module that fuses these
skeleton representations with traditional appearance features, enabling efficient cross-modal spatiotemporal modeling with linear complexity. Our framework achieves state-
of-the-art performance, surpassing the previous method by
14.4% in average mAP.
